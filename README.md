Goals and Introduction: 

We aim to explore and understand the relationships among various housing characteristics, such as price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and 
bathrooms, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, and Clustering for houses in Bay Area, California. Some relationships we can 
predict are: predicted price by square footage, predicting price by county, and predicting county by square footage. We can use PCA to identify the 
key components that capture the most variance in housing features, such as price per square foot, price per bedroom, and price per bathroom. This will 
help us understand which combinations of features are most influential in describing the overall housing landscape. Factor Analysis can be utilized to 
uncover underlying latent variables or factors that may drive housing market characteristics. For example, factors might reflect "size and amenities" or 
"cost-efficiency," enabling a deeper interpretation of the data's structure. We can apply clustering to group houses into distinct segments based on their 
features. This analysis may reveal natural groupings such as luxury homes, budget-friendly options, or mid-range housing, offering insights into the 
market's composition. Overall, we can investigate the relationships among variables: we can predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. We can analyze how price-per-unit metrics (e.g., price per square foot) vary by cluster. We can also explore potential regional or neighborhood-level trends. Overall, we can use PCA, FA, and the clustering results to understand how different house characteristics correlate with pricing tiers or market segmentation. On a practical level, understanding information regarding rental units can help provide insights to buyers, real estate agents, developers, and sellers on how to evaluate and compare properties based on a simplified set of meaningful variables.

Our Process: 

We first scraped the web for a data set that we find interesting and useful to perform analysis on. We first figured out what our research goals were in relation to the data set. After finding the Rent data set, we went into the data cleanup process. We scrapped the data, then cleaned it for outliers and NA values. After this, we thought of any new features that can be added that would be beneficial in our analysis steps. We performed feature engineering, adding 3 new features to our cleaned data set. We performed correlation analysis on the new cleaned data set and went on to perform PCA, FA, and clustering. We went back and forth, using a shared github repository to work on the same rmd markdown file. We each worked on parts and would commit and push our changes to the repository when done. Then, the other person would go in and pull the changes to work on the updated markdown file. We would meet once a week and go over our changes, giving each other feedback, and editing our work. 

About the Dataset: 

Using a data set from TidyTuesday that contains information about rent prices for houses in the Bay Area of the Bay Area. The data set contains information regarding date of rental, location of the house (like city and county for example), information regarding size of house, and price of rent. The original data set Rent had 200,769 observations among 17 variables. However, as part of our data preprocessing we chose to drop rows that contain NA values and drop rows that contain observations with outliers, as we want our data set to have the most thorough representative data as possible. Considering there were still thousands of observations regarding rental prices in San Francisco, dropping these rows was a better choice than replacing their values, as we chose to only perform analysis on real data. The variables we chose to include in our model were year, neighborhood, city, county, price, beds, baths, sqft, and title. Year is the year the house was on the market, neighborhood, city, and county outline the area the house is located in the Bay Area, price is the rental price is US dollars per one month of rent, beds is the amount of bedrooms the house has, baths is the amount of bathrooms the house has, sqft is the amount of sqft the house has, and title is the title of the rental listing posting. We chose these variables because they are the most representative of houses in the Bay Area in relation to our research question.
